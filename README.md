To whom ever reads this. I am learning coding through The Odin Project.
This is my first ever project show casing what the tools i have learned up to this point. 
I have got the hang of the img elements and links. 
I use the strong and em elements along with the horizontal line i picked up in a video (i liked the look).
I have very basic knowlege but one day at a time im learning new things that peak my interests. 
I hope to be a great coder one day.
Love Booqs <3
