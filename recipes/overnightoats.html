    <h2><strong>Why Overnight Oats?!</strong></h2>
    <p>I just can't get enough of <a href="https://harmlessharvest.com/products/dairy-free-yogurt-alternative?variant=42533303255275">harmless
         harvest</a> plant-based coconut yogurts. I always wanted to make overnight
          oats for my lunchbox while im at work. So I searched this recipe online
           for this project. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>¾ cup of old-fashioned oats</li>
        <li>1 cup of plant-based milk</li>
        <li>½ cup of <a href="https://harmlessharvest.com/products/dairy-free-yogurt-alternative?variant=42533303255275">harmless harvest</a> plant-based coconut yogurt</li>
        <li>¼ cup of mashed ripe banana</li> 
        <li>2 Tablespoons of chia seeds </li>
        <li>¼ cup of chopped fruit (your choice)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to craft the Overnight Oats</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In an airtight container, glass, or mason jar, add oats, milk, yogurt, banana, and chia seeds.</li>
        <li>Cover with lid or aluminum foil, and refrigerate overnight (or for 3+ hours).</li>
        <li>When you wake up, mix, top with chopped fruit, and enjoy chilled. No cooking or heating necessary—the oats “cook” themselves overnight.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Notes</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mix these up right in a mason jar to take them on the go.</li>
    </ul>
